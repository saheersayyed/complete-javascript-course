    <p>HTML stands for Hyper text markup language. HTML is the noun, CSS is the adjective (attributes) and JS is the
        verb. For JS to
        work it, it needs to be embedded into a html file. JS is like application that is running on the edge or on the
        client. There are other variants of JS that work on the server side. Node.js or React.js have libraries that are
        needed for building JS app on the server. </p>

    <p>One more paragraph. Is it right ? The following is an inline element called anchor. An inline element doesn't
        causes any change of line like the other "block" elements like "h1" or "p" does: <a
            href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/saheer/'> My Profile </a> </p>
